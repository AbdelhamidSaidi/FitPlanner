Sets, Reps, and Time-Based Protocols

Hypertrophy (Muscle Growth):

6–12 reps per set, 3–5 sets (Schoenfeld, 2010)

Schoenfeld, B.J. (2010). The mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to resistance training. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 24(10), 2857-2872.

Muscular Endurance:

Higher reps (15–25) with moderate loads (Ratamess, 2012)

Ratamess, N.A. (2012). ACSM’s Foundations of Strength Training and Conditioning. Wolters Kluwer Health.

Fat Loss / Weight Loss:

Moderate reps (12–20) with shorter rest periods to increase metabolic stress (Paoli et al., 2012)

Paoli, A., et al. (2012). Resistance training with moderate loads promotes fat loss and preserves lean mass. Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness, 52(1), 61-67.

Time-Based Isometric Exercises (Plank, Wall Sit):

Hold times of 30–60 seconds per set with multiple sets are effective for core endurance and stability (Escamilla et al., 2010)

Escamilla, R.F., et al. (2010). Core muscle activation during exercises. Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, 40(8), 464-472.

Weight to Bodyweight Ratios

Recommended Load Ratios for Compound Lifts:

Bench Press: ~60–100% of bodyweight depending on experience (Schoenfeld, 2010)

Squats and Deadlifts: 1.0–1.5× bodyweight for intermediate lifters (Schoenfeld, 2010; Stone et al., 2007)

Rows and Pull-Ups: Typically 50–80% bodyweight load equivalents (Gentil et al., 2017)

Assisted vs. Weighted Bodyweight Exercises:

Assistance reduces effective load by ~10–20% of bodyweight for beginners aiming to build strength (Andersen et al., 2014)

Weighted bodyweight exercises increase resistance by adding 10–20% of bodyweight for hypertrophy stimulus (Schoenfeld, 2010)
